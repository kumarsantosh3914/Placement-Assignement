## Assignment 1 HTML

**_Q.1 <!DOCTYPE html> Is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?_**

**Ans -** `<!DOCTYPE html>` is not a tag of HTML; it is called a document type declaration (DTD). It is used to declare the version and type of the HTML document.

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document before the `<html>` tag. It informs the web browser or parser about the version of HTML being used in the document. In this case, it specifies that the document is written in HTML5.

The purpose of the document type declaration is to ensure that the web browser or parser renders the document correctly by following the appropriate set of rules and standards for that HTML version.

**_Q.2 Explain Semantic tags in html. And why do we need it?_**

**Ans-**  Semantic tags in HTML are a set of elements that carry meaning and define the structure and purpose of the content within a web page. These tags provide a way to describe the type of content being marked up, making it more meaningful and semantically understandable by both web browsers and search engines.

Semantic tags are important for several reasons:
Clarity and Readability

- Accessibility
- Search Engine Optimization
- Styling and Design

**_Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?_**

**Ans-** HTML Tags: HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML markup. They are used to define the structure and content of an HTML document. Tags are enclosed in angular brackets(`<` and `>`), and they can be either opening tags or closing tags.
Examples: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<div>` etc.

HTML Elements: HTML elements consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag (if applicable). They represent a complete unit of content within an HTML document. Elements are made up of tags and the content is placed between the opening and closing tags. Examples: `<h1> This is heading </h1>,`<p> This is a paragraph</p>` etc.

**_Q.6 What are some of the advantages of HsTML5 over its previous versions?_**

**Ans-** 1. New Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced a set of semantic elements such as `<header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, etc. These elements provide more meaningful and descriptive structure to web pages, making them easier to understand for both developers and search engines.

2. Improved Multimedia Support: HTML5 includes native support for multimedia elements such as <audio> and <video>. With HTML5, embedding audio and video content in web pages became simpler and more standardised, eliminating the need for external plugins like Flash.
3. Improved Accessibility: HTML5 includes several accessibility features and attributes, making it easier to create web content that is more accessible to users with disabilities. Elements like <nav>, <header>, <footer> etc.

4. Mobile Device Support: HTML5 was designed with mobile devices in mind, providing better support for mobile-specific features like touch events, geolocation, and device orientation. It enables the development of responsive and mobile-friendly websites and web applications.

**_Q.8 What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag?_**

**Ans-** The <features> tag and <img> tag serve different purposes in HTML.

1. <img> tag: The <img> tag is used to embed an image into an HTML document. It is a self-closing tag and does not require a closing tag. The <img> tag is primarily used to display a standalone image on a web page. Example: <img src=” image.jpg” alt=” description of the image”>

2. <figure> tag: The <figure> tag is used to encapsulate media content, such as images, illustrations, diagrams, videos, etc, along with their associate captions or descriptions. It provides a way to group related content together.

Example:

```
<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
  <figcaption>Caption or description of the image</figcaption>
</figure>
```

**_Q.9 What’s the difference between html tag and an attribute and give an example of some
global attributes?_**

**Ans-** In HTML, a tag represents an element, while an attribute provides additional information or modify the behaviour of an HTML element. Here’s the difference between HTML tags and attributes:

1. HTML Tag: 

- An HTML tag represents an element in an HTML document.
  - Tags are used to define the structure and content of the document.
  - Tags are enclosed in angles brackets(<>) and can have an opening tag, closing          tag, or be self-closing.
  -  Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>, <a>, <img>

2. HTML Attribute:

- An HTML attribute provides additional information about an HTML element or modifies its behaviour.
- Attributes are used within the opening tag of an HTML element.
- Examples: class, id, src, href, alt, style etc. 

_Global Attribute:_
Global attributes are attributes that can be used with any HTML element. They provide common functionality and are not specific to any particular element. Here are some examples of global attributes:

1. Class: Specifies one or more names for an element, used for styling or selecting elements with CSS.
Example: <div class=”container”>

2. Id: Specifies a unique identifier for an element, used for targeting specific elements with CSS or JavaScript.
Example: <h1 id=”title”>

3. Style: Specifies inline CSS styles for an element.
Example: <p style=”color: red; font-size: 14px;”>
